yast-fonts
==========

This YaST module brings a layer over fontconfig settings to control
font appearance on the system in two aspects: 
* font rendering algorithm type,
* font family preference.

The main mission is to bring font rendering options closer 
to user. It is intended to weaken term 'default font setting'.

Note: module is just developed, so it do not live in YaST 
namespace so far. For openSUSE 13.2 or later and Factory, please 
find packages in  
[home:pgajdos:font-setting](http://software.opensuse.org/package/yast2-fonts?search_term=yast2-fonts).
